This project will run a simple round-robin scheduler, you can set the amount of memory that the scheduler has access to, 
you can set the burst size to limit how long a task can run before the next one starts. Both the system memory and burst 
size default to being 4 units each.

The scheduler will refuse to run any invalid input and will start the input loop over again. 


How to build

- 'make' to build executable
- 'make clean' to remove executable

How to run
- ratch


Note: I do have the state of the scheduler printed out every time unit instead of only when certain things change. 
      This was to speed up development and because I felt that the important part of the assignment was the 
      scheduler itself and getting that to work, not text formatting.
